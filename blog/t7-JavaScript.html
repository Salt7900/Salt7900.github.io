    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <h4>9.13.2015, 4:48PM</h4>

    <p>
      You'd think that Object-Oriented languages would have more things in common.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then again, when you think about it, you'd think that maybe they should be more differnt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Javascript is different then Ruby. But it isn't that different. A lot of things stay the same- the biggest change is to remember a ; at the end of a line. But for the most part, things are the same, they just go by different names.
    </p>

    <h3>The Hash</h3>

    <p>
      A hash is a Ruby thing. It's a Key-Value pair. Which is a fancy way of saying you want one thing to lead to another - like a dictionary. I have a bag of fruit, and want to document how many of each I have. I can create a hash that is called fruit_count. In it, I say "apple" ==> 3 and "pear" ==> 2. Now, when I want to see how many I have, I can just tell Ruby to look up the hash, and to access the apple part. It will return 3.
    </p>

    <h3>The Object</h3>

    <p>
      Let's first say that everything in ruby is an object. Even the hash, it's just a special kind of object.
    </p>

    <p>
      JavaScript calls things objects, when in reality many other things are also objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as to what it calls an object- it behaves much the same way that a Ruby hash would. Again, saying I have a bag of fruit. When I declare the variable fruit, I'll give it properties, and then those properties will have values. Sounds similar... So, I can again point apple to 3 and pear to 1.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting back to the value</h3>

    <p>
      Now, probably the biggest difference is how you get back to the values.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Ruby, if you want to get to the apple count, you'd do this- <br>fruit_count[:apple]</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      JavaScript is along those lines. You'd say <br>fruit_count.apple</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      In both cases, the output will be 3.
    </p>
