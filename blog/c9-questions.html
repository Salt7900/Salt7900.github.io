  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <h4>9.26.15 8:35PM</h4>

    <p>
      Questions are something that we ask all the time, yet not something that we always get right. It's not always a case of practice makes perfect, but if you know what you want to know, you can know how to ask about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      (A lot of what is talked about in this post is mostly relevant to tech people, but their are bits that can be used by anyone.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The first part, and this is something that I commonly find myself guilty of, is to make sure that you're asking a question. "I did this and then this happened" is not a question. It's a statement.
    </p>

    <p>
      This hasn't been a problem with DBC, but could be on larger projects/forums - always say what you are working in. Mac OSX is going to behave differently then Windows. How unfortunate would it be if you only got answers for the one you're not using?
    </p>

    <p>
      Ask yourself if the question you're asking would make sense if you got asked it. If it doesn't you're never getting an answer.
