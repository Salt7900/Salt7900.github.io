      How can two words- two ideas- that esentially do the same thing be so differnt? How can two words be the difference between code that follows proper usage, and that which doens't? Are those two words a thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Yes they are. And those two words are Class and ID. Both do the same thing- allow for more specific control over formatting when using CSS. They really even do it in the same way. But when you would use them, that is totally differnt, but equally as simple. IDs are used when you only have one thing in the HTML file that you want to change. Classes are used when you have multiple. It's deceptivily simple. But, here's some examples-
    </p>

    <p>
      Say I have a SINGLE H1 tag that I want to change to be green. The HTML is ensentially the same if I had a standard H1 tag- <br> &lth1 id="title"&gtI'l be green!&lt/h1&gt </br> <br>Now, when you're on the CSS page, to change only that H1, instead of all- </br> <br> #title{color:green;}</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now lets say I have two portions of a page. Both contain H2 elememts. On the top part, you want them to be red! The code for each will look the same: <br>&lth1 id="top_of_page_heading"&gtI'l be red!&lt/h1&gt </br>
      <br>Now, when you're on the CSS page, to change only those H2, instead of all- </br> <br> .title{color:red;}</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      The most important thing when it comes to these- and oft forgotten, is how you denote them in the CSS sheet. For classes, simply affix a .
      <br>For ID's, affix a #<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      It's been a crazy week to get to this point from really no knowledge. Let's hope the coming are just as successful.
