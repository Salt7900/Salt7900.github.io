      One of the things that DBC really pushes is the idea of EQ over IQ- that knowing how you learn and how to work with other people is more important then just being smart. In a effort to understand ourselves we all take <a href = "http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> This Quiz. </a> And I ended up with some ansers that I both agree and disagree with. I'm not sure how accurate a test of 15 questions can be at gauging you as a person, but, according to said 15 questions, I'm pretty much dead set on Abstract Sequential and Concrete Random, which mean the following-
    </p>

    <h4>Abstract Sequential</h4>

    <ul>
       <li> This learner likes:
          <ul>
          <li>his/her point to be heard</li>
          <li>analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
          <li>applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> They learn best when:
        <ul>
          <li>they have access to experts or references</li>
          <li>placed in stimulating environments</li>
          <li>able to work alone</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What's hard for them?
          <ul>
          <li> Being forced to work with those of differing views</li>
          <li>Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
          <li>Repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
          <li>Lots of specific rules and regulations</li>
          <li>"sentimental" thinking</li>
          <li> Expressing their emotions</li>
          <li>Being diplomatic when convincing others</li>
          <li>Not monopolizing a conversation</li>
          </ul>
         </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Concrete Random</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This learner likes:
              <ul>
                <li>experimenting to find answers</li>
                <li>take risks</li>
                <li>use their intuition</li>
                <li>solving problems independently</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>They learn best when:
              <ul>
                <li>they are able to use trial-and-error approaches</li>
                <li>able to compete with others</li>
                <li>given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What's hard for them?
              <ul>
                <li>Restrictions and limitations</li>
                <li>Formal reports</li>
                <li>Routines</li>
                <li>Re-doing anything once it is done</li>
                <li>Keeping detailed records</li>
                <li>Showing how they got an answer</li>
                <li>Choosing only one answer</li>
                <li>Having no options</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

    <p>
        I'm sure that parts of this are accurate- I know I don't like formal reports, and having to abide by a long list of rules. I like to think that I don't monopolize when I talk, but I think some of my friends might disagree with that...
    </p>

    <p>
      I think that some of the things mentioned are keys to success at DBC, however. In a typical school setting, everything is rigid. You have no options. Just by defecting to DBC is changing that, which I think benefits me. The hardest thing that DBC has had in stock for me has been the requirement to look past the material. To be able to do blog posts about how I feel, or to be able to leave feedback for people. And while I do have trouble describing how I feel about something, I do think it's for the better that we have to, and I'm sure it's something that gets easier with the more you do it. It all goes hand in hand with mindsets- that of fixed and of growth. Fixed says that you have an intelligence level. And that's what you're stuck with. Growth means you know what you have now, but also know that you can learn more and be in a better spot. It's a fundamental part of what we're doing with DBC. If we took every piece of feedback we get and got discouraged because it wasn't all positive, we'd be nowhere, and would certainly not finish the program.
