    <p>
      Last week, we talked about stereotype threat on a very broad level - how it exists and why, and what we can do to combat it. This week we look a little more personally - why we might feel it and what we can do about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Something that I look at in myself - and the reason that I see a lot of my success - is the idea of personal achievement. We define ourselves by what we do. What we succeed and, and inevitably what we don't.
    </p>

    <p>
      People ask me a lot of things, and a lot of advice goes out on the basis of my past depressive episodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't talk about it as a reason to make people feel sorry for me. I don't use it because I want the easy way in life. I think about it because I got through it - because I continue to get through it. It's not something that just goes away - but it is something that I can beat. And something that, so far, I have beaten every day. And to me, that's an achievement.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't know if that's something that you can be stereotype-ed because of it.. A lot of the thoughts that others have about depression are so far from the truth that I could never think about doing them. I'm not just going to crack and shoot up a mall. I think that we all need to have a conversation about mental health, but that's a blog post for another day.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm proud that I'm able to get up every morning and go about my life. I'm happy that it's not a disabling problem. And a lot of the time, that's all I need. Does it get hard to get up and be energetic sometimes? Yes. But I know that I can get through it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's amazing the things that can push us off the brink. I love music. Mostly U2. It can be inspiring. We all have the little things that make us feel more like us. I also love driving. Sometimes I work myself so far down into a hole, that I can't see a way out, because I can't think straight. If I can take 30 minutes to drive - and not think about the problem - think about where I am and if I want to turn left or right, or take an hour and close my eyes and fall into Achtung Baby, I know that I can work myself out of that hole. And that's an achievement if I've every heard of one.
