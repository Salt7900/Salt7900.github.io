  <h1>Why Classic Schools Don't Work</h1>
  <h2>The Beginning of my Journey. Part Two.</h2>
  <h4>7.1.15 10:15PM</h4>

    <p>
      I feel like somebody has finally started to listen to students all across the country. The idea that school needs to be a singular effort- the idea that only you matter to your success- is no longer right. I'm not sure that it's ever been right. But it certainly isn't any more. Answers aren't just held in books, and grades shouldn't be dependent on what you can memorize. With Google, with Yahoo, with Bing, the answer to everything is only a search away. The world has changed- but the school system has not. We are not at a point where you should be expected to memorize everything - you should know how to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our school system does not accept learning. It accepts grades. This is why so many students feel the need to cheat. It doesn't matter what they have in their head, what matters is the grade at the top of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea in education that we can learn together- succeed together (and inevitably fail together) is revolutionary. The idea that we can work together instead of see others as a threat is amazing. Learning is an amazing thing. It allows people to move up in the world, to empathize with others, and to understand more. I love learning. But I didn't love school. I was never a good student. But I love reading. I spent, and continue to spend, way to much time on Wikipedia reading about anything that remotely interests me. And it's amazing the power that knowledge has. But it's not a power that schools teach you. But- DBC does. It's among the leaders of the pack that is revolutionizing the way we learn. It's amazing to be able to learn, not to memorize with the intention of getting an A.

    <p>
      This is only the beginning for me. And I'm already immensely proud to be a student of DBC. Purple Martins for life!
