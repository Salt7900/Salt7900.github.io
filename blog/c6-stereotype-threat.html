  <h1>Steroytype Threat</h1>
  <h4>9.6.15 12:27AM</h4>

    <p>
      Last week I started off by saying feedback is a wierd thing. This week I say the same thing about stereotype threat. The idea that because I am a member of a group that is bogged down by a steroytype (such as African Americans being less inteligent), I'm going to perform more like that group. In a sense, it goes right along with the impostor sydrome - the idea that you don't deserve to be where you are because you can not see your achivements.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of research to stereotype threat comes from college testing. It's easy to quantify, and thus easy to evaluate. People have found that those groups that are seen as under-achieving (such as the African American population) are less likely to be successful at the SAT, not because they are any less intelligent, but because people think that they are less intelligent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Impostor Syndrome is the idea that you don't deserve to be where you are, and that you've gotten lucky. That you stumbled into something at just the right time and that you will soon be "outed" and kicked out of whatever group you've gotten to or whatever achievements you've gotten will be stripped.
    </p>

    <p>
      The drawback to ST are fairly easy to see. And it fosters itself. It's like a wheel.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think, however, that the larger problem might not be ST itself, but is in the way that we see and test ourselves. A big part of the threat is in SAT and ACT testing. They're major points and scores in anyone's life. But should we put as much emphasis on them as we do? Are they really the best way to measure ourselves? I argue they aren't. They measure nothing more then the ability to memorize information. The problem is not the ST threat exists, but is the reasons that it exists. Yes, you can make the argument that to rid ourselves of ST, we need to remove stereotypes. Which is not untrue, but we should all strive to remove and not pay attention to them outside of this, anyway. But on a bigger scale then just looking at ST, I think we need to look at how we quantify (or qualify)everyone as a person. The SAT can only measure one thing- and people are not made up of only one thing.

    <p>
      Our world is moving ahead at a rapid pace. A rapid pace on a lot of fronts. Biotech, tech, medicine, how long we live, how much food we can make, the amount of people that can get to water. But, especially in the civilized world, we measure ourselves by numbers. What did we get on the ACT? SAT? Last week's physics test? My GPA? And it's been that way forever. Maybe we need to look at more then that. Maybe we need lest testing, and more talking. I'm convinced that a 15 minute conversation with someone could provide more information about a person then the ACT ever could. Yes, stereotype threat is a problem. But it's just one problem that's being perpetuated by the way we measure ourselves. You're not your GPA, and your GPA is not you.
