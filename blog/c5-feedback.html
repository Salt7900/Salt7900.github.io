  <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>
  <h4>7.30.15 2:54PM</h4>

    <p>
      Feedback is kinda a wierd thing. The idea that you can go and tell people- in this case your peers- what they're doing right, and what they're doing wrong. It's weird but it's cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pairing is a huge thing at DBC. It's the way that we learn, the way we check in, and the way we get to know people in Phase 0. And feedback is a huge thing in pairing. Pairing is effective because it shows us what is effective. It tells us what we do right, and what we do wrong. It tells us what we can work on, when to speak up, and when to shut up. It's nice, though, to know that you're not the only one who spends just as much time on RubyDocs as they do in Sublime. There's plenty of times where you think that you're lagging behind or having trouble with that week, and then all the pairing partners agree. Not to say that it is always all positive. There are times where you come away thinking that you're behind or you don't understand.But, in a sense, the point of pairing is not to tell you that making mistakes is bad, but that learning nothing from them is bad.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reading the feedback that people have left is much the same experience. Sometimes you look and say that you nailed it, and sometimes you look and ask yourself how you could have been so foolish. Sometimes there's nothing to take away- just that you were great. Which, while being a great self-esteem boost, doesn't help me very much. I want to know what I did wrong. I want to know what I screwed up, so that next time I don't. And it doesn't need to be mean to be effective. But I still want to know what to work on. For instance, when pairing, I like to just drift off into RubyDocs, leaving my pair not sure what I'm doing, which becomes a huge waste of time for everyone. It's a simple fix- just tell them that I'm diving in to find the answer. But it's not something that I would have realized I was doing if nobody had said it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing feedback, however, is hard. How do you condense all of your interaction over an hour into 4 sentences? How do you remember everything that someone did or didn't do? How can you convert that into words? Writing feedback is just as much a reelection of you as it is of them. How do you nicely put what they need help on? It's all hard, but in the end telling what actually happened is the easiest thing to do. Make sure you comment on what they did well, and what you gained out of the time- but also what they could have done could have done better to help you learn. Pairing isn't about you. It's about helping each other, and will only work as long as everyone agrees with that.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most important thing with feedback is to not read it and be offended. Nobody is perfect, and the sooner that you know that you're not either, the sooner you can really take advantage of the feedback that people leave
    </p>

    <p>
      There's only one thing that should always be the same with the DBC feedback. We get a little check box that asks if we felt we were respected. The answer to that should always be yes, because there's no reason to be disrespectful to you're fellow students. That's the only requirement of the feedback, and it's only a feedback requirement because it's a life requirement.
