    <h1>Online Privacy</h1>
    <h2>The Big Problem that Nobody Wants to Talk About</h2>
    <h4>7.23.15 5:20PM</h4>

    <p>
      There's eight million places I could go with a blog post that start with the title of "Online Privacy". Heck, a guy looking over your shoulder at the local Starbucks could qualify.
    </p>

    <p>
       However, there is one problem that I see as more pressing then any of the others. One that I hope as I get further and further into web development, I find to be largly overstated. The government. Our government. Your governemnt. It doesn't matter. All of them together.
    </p>

    <p>
      An ex-NSA contractor released what they do. What they collect, and how they use it to make a "safer" world. His name was Edward Snowden. I am, in a way, surprised when it comes up and people don't know who is, seeing the huge amount of information he released to the public. We live in an age where everything we do is online. A lot of it is by choice. You voluntarily post where you are, who you're with, why you're there, when you leave, what you spent your day doing. You post this on Facebook, on Twitter. What a lot of people don't realize is that it's all saved, and a lot of it is handed to the government. In parts of Europe, web companies are required to disclose everything they have on you, if you request it. It's not unusual to see these reports over 1500 pages long. Where does it stop? Will we ever, as an online society, be able to gain back the privacy that we had before everything was connected? I hope so, but am unconvinced. Google makes money by selling your information. So does Facebook. And Microsoft. And just about anyone that you think is trustworthy.
    </p>

    <p>The following are programs that governments employ to mine the information that we have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PRISM : United States with Australia, the UK, and the Netherlands</li>
      <li>XKeyscore : United States with Germany and Sweden</li>
      <li>Tempora : UK with the United States </li>
      <li>MUSCULAR : UK with the United States </li>
      <li>Project 6 : Germany with the United States</li>
      <li>Stateroom : Australia, Canada, the UK, and the United States</li>
      <li>Lustre : United States and France</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Where does the line between personal privacy and public safety lie? At the moment, I don't think we know. But I hope we find out soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because it's humorous, but also fairly full of information, I present the following for viewing pleasure. Take it as you will.
